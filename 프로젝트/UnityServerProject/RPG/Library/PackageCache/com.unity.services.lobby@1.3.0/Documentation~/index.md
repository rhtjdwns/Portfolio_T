# Unity Lobby
> Important: The Lobby package is deprecated in Unity 6 and will not receive further updates. The Lobby SDK is now part of the unified Multiplayer Services package (com.unity.services.multiplayer). [Migrate](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/mps-sdk/manual/migration-path) to that package to access ongoing support and improvements.
Please consult the documentation here: https://docs.unity.com/lobby/

You can also go to the [Lobby Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/lobby) to learn more, find documentation, and get support.

## SDK Documentation

The SDK is documented using XML comments. These will work with most IDEs to provide IntelliSense and inline documentation.
