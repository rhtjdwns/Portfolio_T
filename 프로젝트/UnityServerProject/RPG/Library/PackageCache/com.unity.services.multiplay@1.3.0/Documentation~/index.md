# Unity Multiplay Hosting
> Important: The Multiplay Hosting package is deprecated in Unity 6 and will not receive further updates. The Multiplay Hosting SDK is now part of the unified Multiplayer Services package (com.unity.services.multiplayer). [Migrate](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/mps-sdk/manual/migration-path) to that package to access ongoing support and improvements.

Refer to the [SDK overview documentation](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/game-server-hosting/manual/sdk/sdk-overview).

You can also go to the [Multiplay Hosting Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/multiplay) to learn more, find documentation, and get support.

## Multiplay Hosting Authoring
You can create, modify, and upload Multiplay Hosting assets from the Editor. For more information, refer to the full [documentation](./Authoring/index.md).
